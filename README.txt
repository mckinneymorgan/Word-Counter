wordCount.cpp: Calculates how many times a word was utilized, given any text file. The output is piped into a out file and sorted by alphabetical order. May invoke using 'make run' which utilizes the Makefile. Although the program is able to properly store the words and the number of occurences in a hash table, some errors arise during the sorting phase of the program.

Expected input:
 ./wordCount.cpp < INPUT TEXT FILE > OUTPUT DESTINATION

tmpRun.out: Contains output of student designed wordCount program. May invoke 
with 'cat' in the command prompt. Displayed after using 'make run'.

Makefile: Present for easy user compilation of wordCount.cpp.
